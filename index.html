        Ken Miles was key in Ford's triumph at Le Mans in 1966, developing and racing the Ford GT40, as depicted in the film Le Mans '66.
        He also developed the Shelby Cobra. But Miles is also known for missing out on the Le Mans win in 1966; he gave up a dominant lead
        in an effort to ensure a tied finish with the second placed GT40, driven by Bruce McLaren, which went on to be awarded the victory.

        <p>He and Ruby won Daytona 24 Hours for Ford and Shelby American in the MKIIB GT40, with GT40s sweeping all of the podium places.</p>
        <br>
        <p>His greatest triumph came at Le Mans. MkII GT40s were dominating the Le Mans 24 Hours, occupying the top four positions.
           Shelby was ordered to orchestrate a formation finish to trigger a dead heat, with Denny Hulme/Miles in the lead ahead of McLaren/Amon in third.
           Miles slowed down, realising that in the event of a dead heat, the qualifying times would be used and McLaren would have been declared the winner.
        </p>
        <p>Jaded from Ford’s orders, he resigned himself to taking second place and McLaren was the winner.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On August 18, 1966, Miles died testing a J-Car at Californian circuit Riverside.
        Miles died having given Ford and Shelby everything he had, but his life was taken away by the GT40.</p>

    <p>I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others. I should like to drive a Formula One machine,
        not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like. I should think it would be jolly good fun!</p>
